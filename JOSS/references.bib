	abstract = {Many experimental and bioinformatics approaches have been developed to characterize the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. However, the unknown functional relevance of TCR profiling hinders unbiased interpretation of the biology of T cells. To address this inadequacy, we developed tessa, a tool to integrate TCRs with gene expression of T cells to estimate the effect that TCRs confer on the phenotypes of T cells. Tessa leveraged techniques combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with TCR sequencing. We validated tessa and showed its superiority over existing approaches that investigate only the TCR sequences. With tessa, we demonstrated that TCR similarity constrains the phenotypes of T cells to be similar and dictates a gradient in antigen targeting efficiency of T cell clonotypes with convergent TCRs. We showed this constraint could predict a functional dichotomization of T cells postimmunotherapy treatment and is weakened in tumor contexts.},

	abstract = {B-cell receptors (BCRs) are a crucial player in the development and activation of B cells, and their mature forms are secreted as antibodies, which execute functions such as the neutralization of invading pathogens. All current analytical approaches for BCRs solely investigate the BCR sequences and ignore their correlations with the transcriptomics of the B cells, yielding conclusions of unknown functional relevance regarding the roles of BCRs and B cells, and could generate biased interpretation. Many single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques can now capture both the gene expression and BCR of each B cell, which could potentially address this issue. Here, we investigated 43,938 B cells from 13 scRNA-seq datasets with matched scBCR sequencing, and we observed an association between the BCRs and the B cells’ transcriptomics. Motivated by this, we developed the Benisse model (BCR embedding graphical network informed by scRNA-seq) to provide refined analyses of BCRs guided by single-cell gene expression. Benisse revealed a gradient of B-cell activation along BCR trajectories. We discovered a stronger coupling between BCRs and B-cell gene expression during COVID-19 infections. We found that BCRs form a directed pattern of continuous and linear evolution to achieve the highest antigen targeting efficiency, compared with the convergent evolution pattern of T-cell receptors. Overall, a simultaneous digestion of the BCR and gene expression of B cells, viewed through the lens of Benisse, will lead to a more insightful interpretation of the functional relevance of the BCR repertoire in different biological contexts.},

	abstract = {Apparent parallels between natural language and biological sequence have led to a recent surge in the application of deep language models (LMs) to the analysis of antibody and other biological sequences. However, a lack of a rigorous linguistic formalization of biological sequence languages, which would define basic components, such as lexicon (i.e., the discrete units of the language) and grammar (i.e., the rules that link sequence well-formedness, structure, and meaning) has led to largely domain-unspecific applications of LMs, which do not take into account the underlying structure of the biological sequences studied. A linguistic formalization, on the other hand, establishes linguistically-informed and thus domain-adapted components for LM applications. It would facilitate a better understanding of how differences and similarities between natural language and biological sequences influence the quality of LMs, which is crucial for the design of interpretable models with extractable sequence-functions relationship rules, such as the ones underlying the antibody specificity prediction problem. Deciphering the rules of antibody specificity is crucial to accelerating rational and in silico biotherapeutic drug design. Here, we formalize the properties of the antibody language and thereby establish not only a foundation for the application of linguistic tools in adaptive immune receptor analysis but also for the systematic immunolinguistic studies of immune receptor specificity in general.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The clonal theory of adaptive immunity proposes that immunological responses are encoded by increases in the frequency of lymphocytes carrying antigen-specific receptors. In this study, we measure the frequency of different T-cell receptors (TcR) in CD4 + T cell populations of mice immunized with a complex antigen, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis , using high throughput parallel sequencing of the TcR β chain. Our initial hypothesis that immunization would induce repertoire convergence proved to be incorrect, and therefore an alternative approach was developed that allows accurate stratification of TcR repertoires and provides novel insights into the nature of CD4 + T-cell receptor recognition. Results: To track the changes induced by immunization within this heterogeneous repertoire, the sequence data were classified by counting the frequency of different clusters of short (3 or 4) continuous stretches of amino acids within the antigen binding complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) repertoire of different mice. Both unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine) analyses of these different distributions of sequence clusters differentiated between immunized and unimmunized mice with 100\% efficiency. The CD4 + TcR repertoires of mice 5 and 14 days postimmunization were clearly different from that of unimmunized mice but were not distinguishable from each other. However, the repertoires of mice 60 days postimmunization were distinct both from naive mice and the day 5/14 animals. Our results reinforce the remarkable diversity of the TcR repertoire, resulting in many diverse private TcRs contributing to the T-cell response even in genetically identical mice responding to the same antigen. However, specific motifs defined by short stretches of amino acids within the CDR3 region may determine TcR specificity and define a new approach to TcR sequence classification.

However, most analyses have been restricted to quantitative measures such as clonality that do not leverage the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequence. We use DeepTCR, a framework of deep learning algorithms, to reveal sequence concepts that are predictive of response to immunotherapy. We demonstrate that DeepTCR can predict response and use the model to infer the antigenic specificities of the predictive signature and their unique dynamics during therapy. The predictive signature of nonresponse is associated with high frequencies of TCRs predicted to recognize tumor-specific antigens, and these tumor-specific TCRs undergo a higher degree of dynamic changes on therapy in nonresponders versus responders. These results are consistent with a biological model where the hallmark of nonresponders is an accumulation of tumor-specific T cells that undergo turnover on therapy, possibly because of the dysfunctional state of these T cells in nonresponders.},

These huge immune repertoires in each individual present investigators with the challenge of extracting meaningful biological information from multi-dimensional data. The ability to embed these DNA and amino acid textual sequences in a vector-space is an important step towards developing effective analysis methods. Here we present Immune2vec, an adaptation of a natural language processing (NLP)-based embedding technique for BCR repertoire sequencing data. We validate Immune2vec on amino acid 3-gram sequences, continuing to longer BCR sequences, and finally to entire repertoires. Our work demonstrates Immune2vec to be a reliable low-dimensional representation that preserves relevant information of immune sequencing data, such as n-gram properties and IGHV gene family classification. Applying Immune2vec along with machine learning approaches to patient data exemplifies how distinct clinical conditions can be effectively stratified, indicating that the embedding space can be used for feature extraction and exploratory data analysis.},

	abstract = {The targeting of somatic hypermutation (SHM) occurs at two distinct levels. 'Global' targeting refers to the fact that rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions are the primary substrate for SHM. By contrast, 'local' targeting refers to the observation that mutations are confined to a 1–2 kilobase (kb) region in the variable region.SHM was once thought to target rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions exclusively. It has now been shown to occasionally mistarget oncogenes, including B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and CD95.Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for SHM, but the substrate specificity of AID cannot explain the targeting of SHM.DNA-repair processes are typically error-free but during SHM they are likely to be perturbed and rendered error-prone. The resulting error-prone repair pathway(s) must be targeted to rearranged immunoglobulin variable regions.Studies using κ-light chain (Igκ)-like transgenes showed that immunoglobulin enhancer regions are required for targeting SHM to variable regions. More recently, however, studies of endogenous immunoglobulin loci have called into question both the role of immunoglobulin enhancers in SHM and the usefulness of traditional transgenes in dissecting the molecular mechanism of targeting.Conventional histone modifications do not seem to have a direct role in targeting SHM. By contrast, the modification H2BSer14P (histone H2B phosphorylated on serine residue 14) is spatially and temporally correlated with SHM.Recent insights and the development of new experimental strategies should continue to determine the mechanisms by which SHM is targeted to immunologlobulin loci, as well as the reason that this reaction is occasionally mistargeted to oncogenes.},

To produce data for training deep neural networks, we deep-sequenced libraries of the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (about 1 × 104 variants), expressed in a mammalian cell line through site-directed mutagenesis via CRISPR–Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair, and screened the libraries for specificity to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). We then used the trained neural networks to screen a computational library of approximately 1 × 108 trastuzumab variants and predict the HER2-specific subset (approximately 1 × 106 variants), which can then be filtered for viscosity, clearance, solubility and immunogenicity to generate thousands of highly optimized lead candidates. Recombinant expression and experimental testing of 30 randomly selected variants from the unfiltered library showed that all 30 retained specificity for HER2.

	abstract = {In order to describe the conformational and other physical properties of the 20 naturally occurring amino acid residues with a minimum number of parameters, several multivariate statistical analyses were applied to 188 of their physical properties and ten orthogonal properties (factors) were obtained for the 20 amino acids without losing the information contained in the original physical properties. The analysis consisted of three main steps. First, 72 of the physical properties were eliminated from further consideration because they did not pass statistical tests that they follow a normal distribution. Second, the remaining 116 physical properties of the amino acids were classified by a cluster analysis to eliminate duplications of highly correlated physical properties. This led to nine clusters, each of which was characterized by an average characteristic property, namely bulk, two hydrophobicity indices for free amino acids, one hydrophobicity index for amino acid residues in a protein, two types of β-structure preference, α-helix preference, and two types of bend-structure preference. The physical properties within a given cluster were highly correlated with each other, but the correlation between clusters was low. Third, a factor analysis was applied to the nine average classified properties and 16 additional physical properties to obtain a small number of orthogonal properties (ten factors). Four of these factors arise from the nine characteristic properties, and the remaining six factors were obtained from the 16 physical properties not included in the nine characteristic properties. Finally, most of the 188 physical properties could be expressed as a sum of these ten orthogonal factors, with appropriate weighting factors. Since these factors contain information relating almost all properties of all 20 amino acids, it is possible to estimate the numerical values of a property for one or two amino acids for which experimental data for this property are not available. For example, the estimated values for the Zimm-Bragg parameters at 20°C are 0.66 and 0.92 for proline and cysteine, respectively, computed from the first four factors.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in single-cell immune profiling that enable the measurement of the transcriptome and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences simultaneously have emerged as a promising approach to study immune responses at cellular resolution. Yet, combining these different types of information from multiple datasets into a joint representation is complicated by the unique characteristics of each modality and the technical effects between datasets. Here, we present mvTCR, a multimodal generative model to learn a unified representation across modalities and datasets for joint analysis of single-cell immune profiling data. We show that mvTCR allows the construction of large-scale and multimodal T-cell atlases by distilling modality-specific properties into a shared view, enabling unique and improved data analysis. Specifically, we demonstrated mvTCR’s potential by revealing and separating SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell clusters from bystanders that would have been missed in individual unimodal data analysis. Finally, mvTCR can enable automated analysis of new datasets when combined with transfer-learning approaches.
Overall, mvTCR provides a principled solution for standard analysis tasks such as multimodal integration, clustering, specificity analysis, and batch correction for single-cell immune profiling data.},

	abstract = {Single-cell sequencing is an emerging technology in the field of immunology and oncology that allows researchers to couple RNA quantification and other modalities, like immune cell receptor profiling at the level of an individual cell. A number of workflows and software packages have been created to process and analyze single-cell transcriptomic data. These packages allow users to take the vast dimensionality of the data generated in single-cell-based experiments and distill the data into novel insights. Unlike the transcriptomic field, there is a lack of options for software that allow for single-cell immune receptor profiling. Enabling users to easily combine mRNA and immune profiling, scRepertoire was built to process data derived from 10x Genomics Chromium Immune Profiling for both T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) enrichment workflows and subsequently interacts with a number of popular R packages for single-cell expression, such as Seurat. The scRepertoire R package and processed data are open source and available on
GitHub and provides in-depth tutorials on the capability of the package.},

	abstract = {The adaptive immune system recognizes tumor antigens at an early stage to eradicate cancer cells. This process is accompanied by systemic proliferation of the tumor antigen–specific T lymphocytes. While detection of asymptomatic early-stage cancers is challenging due to small tumor size and limited somatic alterations, tracking peripheral T cell repertoire changes may provide an attractive solution to cancer diagnosis. Here, we developed a deep learning method called DeepCAT to enable de novo prediction of cancer-associated T cell receptors (TCRs). We validated DeepCAT using cancer-specific or non-cancer TCRs obtained from multiple major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) multimer-sorting experiments and demonstrated its prediction power for TCRs specific to cancer antigens. We blindly applied DeepCAT to distinguish over 250 patients with cancer from over 600 healthy individuals using blood TCR sequences and observed high prediction accuracy, with area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.95 for multiple early-stage cancers. This work sets the stage for using the peripheral blood TCR repertoire for noninvasive cancer detection.},

	abstract = {Biological sequences are composed of long strings of alphabetic letters rather than arrays of numerical values. Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.},
