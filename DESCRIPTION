Description: Implementation of the Ibex algorithm for single-cell embedding based on BCR sequences. The package includes a standalone function to encode BCR sequence information by amino acid properties or sequence order using tensorflow-based autoencoder. In addition, the package interacts with SingleCellExperiment or Seurat data objects.
